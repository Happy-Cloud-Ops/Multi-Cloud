GIT

Why Source Control 

Backup / Archive
Versioning / History
Undo Changes
Comparing
Collaboration / Teamwork
Blame / Learning Moment
Isolation of Changes
Experimentation
Context Switching
Code Review

Software Developers / Engineers / programmers

Source Code ( Java, C++, Objective-C, Ruby, etc)
Modules (UML, ERB)
SQL, configuration, text files

Freelancers

Web Designers

Graphic Artists

Share code / Open Source

Source Control Options


2 Main Types

Centralized
Decentralized / Distributed

Centralized

Free : Subversion, CVS
Comercial: ClearCase, Perforce, Team Foundation Server (TFS)
Requires connection to central server for most operations

Distributed: 

Mecurial (Hg)
Git
Most operations are local
central server not required

Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCS) use a single central repository where all version history is stored, while Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS) store the full history of the project on each developer's local machine. CVCS relies on a central server for operations, while DVCS allows for offline work and more flexible branching/merging

Key Differences: 
Repository Location:
CVCS has one central repository, while DVCS stores a copy of the entire repository on each developer's machine. 
Network Dependency:
CVCS requires a network connection for most operations, while DVCS allows for offline work and synchronizes changes later. 
Branching and Merging:
CVCS can have limited branching and merging capabilities, while DVCS offers more flexibility in branching and merging due to local copies. 
Speed and Performance:
CVCS can be slower due to network dependency, while DVCS offers faster performance as most operations are local. 
Data Backup and Recovery:
CVCS relies on the central server for backups, which can be a single point of failure. DVCS provides data backup and recovery since each developer has a complete copy. 
Collaboration:
CVCS requires more centralized control and coordination, while DVCS facilitates parallel development and more independent work. 
Scalability:
CVCS scalability can be limited by the central server, while DVCS scales more easily due to distributed workload. 


What is Git ?


Distributed Source Control System
-Not required to be decentralized

Massively sales
Open Source
Developed for Linux project requirements
Most operations are local
Very Fast
Active community
Most popular DVCS, VCS



Key Concepts

Repository contains files, history, config managed by Git
3 Stages of Git

- Working directory
- Staging area - pre-commit holding area
- Commit - Git Repository (history)

Remote repository (GitHub)
